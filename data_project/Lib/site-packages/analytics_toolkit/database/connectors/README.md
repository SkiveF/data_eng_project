# Catalina - Analytics Toolkit

## Description

The toolkit contains connectors to multiple Catalina databases and systems, such as:

- [Yellowbrick](yellowbrick)
- [Snowflake](snowflake)
- [Oracle](oracle) (for access to the POCFR3 database)

Follow the links to find explanations on the connectors and usage examples.

## Important observation

Data types might not be consistent across connectors. Here are some cases where it might differ:

- Integer columns with NAs: Int64 or float 64 for YB, int64 or float64 for the generic connector
  (at least, it seems like)
- Boolean columns wth NAs: transformed into for YB/YBTools, left as strings for the generic connector

## TO-DO list

TO-DO list for Yellowbrick: [here](yellowbrick#to-do-list)  
TO-DO list for Snowflake: [here](snowflake#to-do-list)  
TO-DO list for Oracle: [here](oracle#to-do-list)  

Generic TO-DOs:

- Remove prompting username / password in the connector
- Handle timeout of psycopg2 sessions: add a refresh method?
